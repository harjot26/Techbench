# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.

##### The below documents and instruction is for this project I made and used in this project, please do follow step by step:

## Warning Or must do step for future:

- "Hey, you have native folders, so be careful! If you change settings like icon, orientation, etc. in app.json, you must run npx expo prebuild again to update your native code."
  If you forget to do that, your app might behave weirdly.

## Some Important Steps to Follow to use particular components:

-- To use our own logo in a splashscreen and also show the logo the app after making changes in app.json file you must run this command so effects can be implemented - [npx-expo-prebuild] then re run the android and ios command separetly.

- [Commands-to-follow]:

- bunx expo start -c
- bun expo start --dev-client
- bun add package name
- I have used bun command to create a project( bun create expo app-name).
- Used this [bunx expo prebuild --clean] command to build the preBuild for ios and android.
- bun run ios, bun run android, bun run start or bunx expo run:android, bunx expo run:ios.
- I have put these ios and android in gitIgnore [./android, ./ios]
- To install any Expo library, you can use bun expo install:

- [To-Remove-Packages-Command]:

- bun remove package name
- npm uninstall package name

-- [To-use-Satoshi-Fonts-in-expo-react-native-project],
-- installed from FontShare website,
-- it comes in a single file inside the variable folder with the extension of .ttf,
-- after installing the family font click on the satoshi-variable.ttf and install all the fonts(like: regular, medium and so on..) and same for the italic ones.
-- now after installing all the fonts type, click on i button and see the name of the Full Family Name if that name isn't matching file name then copy the Full Family Name and change to the file name as well.
-- next run this npx expo install expo-asset command to link the fonts to our project and easily can be run on android and ios
-- create a helper function for all custom fonts like I did inside Utils folder fonts.ts
-- need to make changes in tailwind.confiq.js file as well.
